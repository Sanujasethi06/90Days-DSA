# 90Days-DSA

DAY 1
-----
On day 1 learned about difference between DATA STRUCTURE and ALGORITHM

Difference between DATABASE,DATA WAREHOUSE and BIG DATA
  
  how program is processed in memory?
  -----------------------------------
  STACKS(HOW FUNCTION CALLING HAS EXECUTED INSIDE THE STACK BY SEGMENT)
  
  HEAP (FOR DYNAMIC PROGRAMMNG USING POINTER)
  
  TIME COMPLEXITY AND BIG O NOTATION:
  ----------------------------------
  DEFINATION AND HOW TIME COMPLEXITY IS INCREASES WITH SPACE COMPLEXITY
  
  EXPLANATION FOR BIG O NOTATION WITH METAPHORICAL DEFINATION
  
 DAY 2
 ------
  ASYMPTOTIC:
  ----------
  
  BIG 'O' NOTATION:
  -----------------
  A FUNCTION F(n) IS SAID TO BE O(g(n)) IF AND ONLY IF THERE EXISTS CONSTANT 'C' & A CONSTANT  N_0 STATE THAT
  
  i.e 0<=F(N)<=C g(n)
  
  
  BIG OMEGA:
  
  0<=C g(n)<=F(N)
  
  
  BIG THETA:
  
  DIFFERENT TYPES OF CASES WHILE SOLVING AN ALGORITHM
  ---------------------------------------------------
  
  THERE ARE THREE TYPE OF CASES DURING SOLVING A PROBLEM i.e
  1.BEST CASE
  2.WORST CASE
  3.EXPECTED CASE(AVERAGE CASE)
  
  DAY 3
---------
IT IS ABOUT ABSTRACT DATATYPE (ADT):
-----------------------------------
ADT CONTAINS MININMAL ------->MINIMAL REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY + OPERATIONS

MINIMAL REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITTY:
-------------------------------
GET(i)-----> GET ELEMENT i,
SET(i,num) ----> SET ELEMENT i ,TO NUMBER REPRESENTATION

OPERATIONS:
----------
MAX()

MIN()

SEARCH()

INSERT(I,NUM)

APPEND(x)

push(): When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.

pop(): When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.

isEmpty(): It determines whether the stack is empty or not.

isFull(): It determines whether the stack is full or not.'

peek(): It returns the element at the given position.

count(): It returns the total number of elements available in a stack.

change(): It changes the element at the given position.

display(): It prints all the elements available in the stack.
